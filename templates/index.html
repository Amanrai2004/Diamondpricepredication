            <h2>Carat</h2>
            <p>A diamond's carat is a unit of measurement used to express its weight. One carat is equivalent to 200 milligrams or 0.2 grams.
             Diamonds are often measured in carats because even a small difference in weight can significantly affect a diamond's value and 
             appearance. The term "carat" comes from the carob seeds that ancient merchants used to use as counterweights on their balance scales.</p>
            
            <li>1 Carat: Equivalent to 200 milligrams or 0.2 grams.</li>
            <li>100 Points: Diamonds are often subdivided into points for precision. One carat is divided into 100 points.</li>
            <li>5 Carats: Considered a significant milestone in diamond size and often associated with luxury and rarity.</li>
            <li>1 Carat Equivalent (Ct. eq.) in Other Gemstones: The term "carat" is also used for other gemstones. For instance, a one-carat diamond is about the same size as a 6.5mm diameter round sapphire.</li>
            <li>Troy Ounce to Carat Conversion: One troy ounce is equivalent to 141.747615 carats.</li>

            <h2>Diamond Depth</h2>
            <p>
              The depth of a diamond is a crucial factor in determining its brilliance and overall appearance. It is measured from the culet (the bottom point) to the table (the flat top surface). Here are some key points related to diamond depth:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Ideal Depth Percentage:</strong> For round brilliant diamonds, the ideal depth percentage is typically between 59% and 62.5%. This range ensures optimal light reflection and refraction, resulting in maximum brilliance.</li>
              <li><strong>Shallow Diamonds:</strong> Diamonds with shallow depth percentages (< 59%) may appear larger but often lack brilliance and can have a dull or glassy appearance.</li>
              <li><strong>Deep Diamonds:</strong> Diamonds with deep depth percentages (> 62.5%) may exhibit dark areas or a 'nail head' effect when viewed from above, as light escapes through the sides instead of reflecting back to the viewer's eye.</li>
              <li><strong>Measuring Depth:</strong> Depth is typically expressed as a percentage of the diamond's average girdle diameter. It is one of the measurements provided in a diamond's grading report.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When selecting a diamond, it's essential to consider depth along with other factors such as cut, color, and clarity to ensure you choose a stone with optimal brilliance and beauty.

            <h2>Diamond Dimensions</h2>
            <p>
              Diamond dimensions refer to the various measurements used to describe a diamond's shape, size, and proportions. Understanding these dimensions is essential when selecting a diamond for jewelry. Here are some key terms related to diamond dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Length:</strong> The distance from one end of the diamond to the other, measured along the longest axis.</li>
              <li><strong>Width:</strong> The distance from one side of the diamond to the other, measured perpendicular to the length.</li>
              <li><strong>Depth:</strong> The distance from the table (top surface) to the culet (bottom point) of the diamond, measured perpendicular to the table.</li>
              <li><strong>Girdle:</strong> The outer edge or perimeter of the diamond, where the crown (top) and pavilion (bottom) meet.</li>
              <li><strong>Table:</strong> The flat top surface of the diamond, located in the center of the crown.</li>
              <li><strong>Culet:</strong> The small facet at the bottom of the diamond, which may be pointed or slightly rounded.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These dimensions are used to determine a diamond's overall shape, proportions, and quality. They play a crucial role in evaluating a diamond's beauty, brilliance, and value.

            <h2>Diamond Cuts</h2>
            <p>
              The cut of a diamond refers to its shape, proportions, symmetry, and finish. It plays a significant role in determining a diamond's brilliance, fire, and overall beauty. Here are some popular diamond cuts:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Round Brilliant Cut:</strong> This classic cut features a round shape with 58 facets, designed to maximize brilliance and sparkle.</li>
              <li><strong>Princess Cut:</strong> A square or rectangular-shaped cut with pointed corners, known for its sharp angles and exceptional brilliance.</li>
              <li><strong>Emerald Cut:</strong> A rectangular or square-shaped cut with step-like facets, offering a unique combination of elegance and clarity.</li>
              <li><strong>Cushion Cut:</strong> A square or rectangular-shaped cut with rounded corners, known for its soft, pillow-like appearance and excellent brilliance.</li>
              <li><strong>Asscher Cut:</strong> Similar to the emerald cut but with a square shape and larger step facets, creating a captivating vintage look.</li>
              <li><strong>Marquise Cut:</strong> An elongated, boat-shaped cut with pointed ends, designed to maximize carat weight and create the illusion of length.</li>
              <li><strong>Oval Cut:</strong> A modified round brilliant cut with an elongated oval shape, offering brilliance and elegance with a unique twist.</li>
              <li><strong>Heart Cut:</strong> A romantic cut with a heart-shaped outline, symbolizing love and affection.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each diamond cut has its own distinctive characteristics and beauty, making it important to consider personal preference and style when choosing a diamond.

            <h2>Diamond Quality Parameters</h2>
            <p>When assessing the quality of a diamond, several factors are considered:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cut Quality:</strong> The cut of a diamond refers to its proportions, symmetry, and polish. A well-cut diamond reflects light brilliantly, maximizing its sparkle and beauty.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Color:</strong> Diamonds come in a range of colors, from colorless to yellow or brown. The most valuable diamonds are colorless, with less presence of yellow or brown hues.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Clarity:</strong> Clarity measures the presence of internal flaws (inclusions) and external blemishes. Diamonds with fewer inclusions and blemishes are considered more valuable.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Carat Weight:</strong> Carat weight refers to the size of the diamond. Larger diamonds are rarer and typically more valuable, but other factors like cut, color, and clarity also affect value.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Fluorescence:</strong> Fluorescence is a diamond's reaction to ultraviolet light. Some diamonds may exhibit fluorescence, which can affect their appearance under certain lighting conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Symmetry:</strong> Symmetry refers to how well the facets of a diamond align with each other. Diamonds with excellent symmetry have a balanced and pleasing appearance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Polish:</strong> Polish describes the smoothness of the diamond's surface. A well-polished diamond reflects light evenly and enhances its overall brilliance.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <section id="hardness" class="hardness">
            <h2Hardness</h2>
            <p>The hardness of a diamond is unparalleled, scoring 10 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. This means diamonds are extremely resistant to scratching and abrasion, making them ideal for use in jewelry and cutting tools.</p>
